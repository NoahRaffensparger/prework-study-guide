# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a study guide designed to help me organize and study the things I learned during the Prework for Coding Bootcamp. The reason for making this was so that I could practice my coding skills, and I could have a hub for the information I have learned and will learn in the future. By creating this website, I have displayed my skills in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
